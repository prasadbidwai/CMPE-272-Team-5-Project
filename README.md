It analyses the data like endangered animal species around the world, pattern of decline in their population, threats that are affecting animal population and solutions to avoid them.

The statistics section of the application shows the data like "Country-wise count of threatened animals as per their
class" with the help of different charts like column chart, donut chart and world map. We are also plotting the animal population information on line graph which is with respect to time. Multiple animal class data can also be compared with each other.
